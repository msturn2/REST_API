# *REST_API*
In this project, I create a REST API using Express. This API will provide a way to administer a school database containing information about users and courses. Users can interact with the database to create new courses, retrieve information on existing courses, and update or delete existing courses. To make changes to the database, users will be required to log in so the API will also allow users to create a new account or retrieve information on an existing account.

## Using this Application

- This application uses node.js. If you do not already have node.js installed, visit https://nodejs.org/en/download/ and install.
- After installing node, navigate to the root directory of the cloned repo in a Terminal, Command Prompt or Git Bash.
